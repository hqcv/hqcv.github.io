## Understanding OKX Referral Programs

OKX, a leading cryptocurrency trading platform, offers users powerful tools to reduce trading costs through its referral ecosystem. By leveraging promo codes and referral links, traders can access valuable benefits while expanding the platform's user base.

### Core Program Mechanics
The referral system operates on a two-tier structure:
- **New Traders** receive 20% discounts on trading fees
- **Referrers** earn rewards based on their referrals' trading activity

This mutually beneficial arrangement creates value for both experienced traders and newcomers to the crypto market. To activate these benefits, users simply need to apply a valid promo code during account creation or share their unique referral link.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I find my personal referral code?
Your unique referral code becomes available once you've completed account verification on OKX. Navigate to the "Invite Friends" section in your account dashboard to access and customize your referral tools.

### What's the difference between promo codes and referral links?
While both deliver discounts, promo codes are standardized offers from OKX, whereas referral links are personalized URLs that track your specific recommendations. Both provide 20% trading fee discounts but serve different marketing purposes.

### Can I combine multiple promo codes?
OKX allows only one promo code per account. For maximum benefit, we recommend using established codes like "Laura17777" which have proven track records of successful discount application.

# OKX Launches WCT/USDT Spot Trading  

Cryptocurrency exchange OKX has announced the launch of **WCT/USDT spot trading**, introducing WalletConnect (WCT) to its platform. This article provides comprehensive details about the trading schedule, order restrictions, price limit mechanisms, and auction procedures for this new trading pair.  

## Trading Launch Schedule  

The WCT/USDT trading pair will follow a structured rollout schedule:  

- **Auction Period**: April 15, 2025, 6:00 PM â€“ 7:00 PM (UTC+8)  
- **Spot Trading Start**: April 15, 2025, 7:00 PM (UTC+8)  
- **Withdrawal Activation**: April 16, 2025, 7:00 PM (UTC+8)  

This phased approach ensures market stability while allowing traders to prepare for liquidity.  

## Order Restrictions for Market Protection  

To mitigate price volatility during the initial trading phase, OKX will enforce temporary order limits for the first 5 minutes after market open:  

1. **No Market Orders**: Only limit orders will be accepted.  
2. **Max Limit Order Size**: $10,000 per transaction.  
3. **User Net Position Cap**: $10,000 maximum per trader.  

These restrictions automatically lift after the 5-minute window, restoring standard trading functionality.  

## Price Limit Rules Explained  

OKX employs dual pricing mechanisms to stabilize new listings:  

### **Phase 1: Index Price Unavailable**  
When stable index pricing isnâ€™t available, rules are:  

| Stage | Buy Order Cap | Sell Order Floor |  
|-------|---------------|------------------|  
| First Minute | Auction Price Ã— (1 + H) | No Limit |  
| Minutes 1â€“N (No Index) | Previous Close Ã— (1 + H) | No Limit |  
| After N Minutes | No Limit | No Limit |  

### **Phase 2: Index Price Available**  
Once stable index data exists, rules shift to:  

| Stage | Buy Order Cap | Sell Order Floor |  
|-------|---------------|------------------|  
| First 10 Minutes | Index Ã— (1 + X) | Index Ã— (1 â€“ X) |  
| After 10 Minutes | Min[Max(Index, Index Ã— (1 + Y) + Avg Premium), Index Ã— (1 + Z)] | Max[Min(Index, Index Ã— (1 â€“ Y) + Avg Premium), Index Ã— (1 â€“ Z)] |  

Platform reserves the right to adjust parameters (H, X, Y, Z) without prior notice.  

## Auction Mechanism Details  

OKXâ€™s 1-hour auction period enables traders to submit pre-orders at desired prices. Key features include:  

- **User Buy Limit**: $50,000 maximum during auction.  
- **Final 5 Minutes**: Only limit orders allowed; no modifications or cancellations.  
- **Opening Price**: Determined by the project team, not auction results, serving as a reference point.  

This mechanism balances liquidity preparation with fair price discovery.

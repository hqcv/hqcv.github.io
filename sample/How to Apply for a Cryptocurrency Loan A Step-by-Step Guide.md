## Why Consider Crypto Loans?  

Cryptocurrency holders often face a dilemma: sell assets to access funds or retain holdings during market volatility. Crypto loans resolve this through collateralization, where users pledge their crypto as security for fiat or stablecoin loans. This approach:  
- Preserves ownership of appreciating assets  
- Provides immediate liquidity for emergencies, investments, or business needs  
- Avoids taxable events associated with crypto sales  

Traditional financing methods typically require credit checks and lengthy approval processes. Crypto loans streamline access through blockchain technology, offering transparent terms and rapid disbursement. The integration of smart contracts ensures automated repayment tracking and collateral management.

### Core Benefits  
| Advantage | Description |  
|----------|-------------|  
| Liquidity Access | Convert crypto holdings to cash without selling |  
| Market Participation | Maintain crypto exposure during price cycles |  
| Flexible Terms | Choose loan duration and repayment structures |  
| Global Accessibility | Available to users worldwide without banking intermediaries |

### Step 2: Deposit Cryptocurrency  
Supported collateral options include:  
- Bitcoin (BTC)  
- Ethereum (ETH)  
- XEM (XEM)  
- DASH (DASH)  

**Deposit Instructions:**  
1. Navigate to the Wallet section in your dashboard  
2. Select the desired cryptocurrency  
3. Copy the generated deposit address  
4. Transfer funds from your external wallet  

Ensure transactions confirm on the blockchain before proceeding. Network fees (gas) vary by cryptocurrency and network congestion levels.

### Step 3: Customize Loan Terms  
Loan parameters include:  
- Loan amount (â‚¬100 - â‚¬1,000,000)  
- Loan currency (EUR, USDT, BTC, ETH, BNK, XEM, DASH)  
- Repayment period (1-24 months)  

**Interest Rate Factors:**  
- Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio  
- Chosen repayment currency  
- Collateral asset volatility  

The platform calculates required collateral based on current market prices and selected LTV. Users opting to pay interest with BNK tokens receive preferential rates.

### Step 4: Loan Disbursement  
Upon approval:  
1. Funds appear in your Bankera Loans wallet  
2. Monthly interest deductions begin automatically  
3. Collateral remains secured until full repayment  

Monitor your LTV ratio through the dashboard. Exceeding maximum thresholds triggers partial liquidation of collateral to maintain required ratios.

## Frequently Asked Questions  

**Q: What collateral requirements exist?**  
A: Minimum loan amounts start at â‚¬100. Required collateral depends on selected LTV and cryptocurrency volatility. Stablecoins typically allow higher LTV ratios than volatile assets.

**Q: Which cryptocurrencies are supported?**  
A: Current options include Bitcoin, Ethereum, XEM, and DASH. Additional assets will be added based on market demand and regulatory compliance.

**Q: How are interest rates determined?**  
A: Rates vary with collateral type, loan duration, and payment currency. Using BNK tokens for interest payments reduces annual percentage rates by up to 2%.

**Q: What happens if loan terms are breached?**  
A: If LTV exceeds agreed thresholds, the platform automatically liquidates portions of collateral to reduce risk exposure. Users receive notifications before liquidation occurs.

**Q: Can loans be repaid early?**  
A: Yes, borrowers may settle loans at any time without prepayment penalties. Early repayment reduces total interest costs.

## Risk Management Strategies  

Effective crypto loan management requires understanding market dynamics and implementing protective measures:  

1. **Diversify Collateral** - Spread risk across multiple cryptocurrencies  
2. **Monitor Market Conditions** - Set price alerts for collateral assets  
3. **Maintain Buffer Margins** - Keep LTV below maximum thresholds  
4. **Use Stop-Loss Orders** - Protect against sudden market downturns

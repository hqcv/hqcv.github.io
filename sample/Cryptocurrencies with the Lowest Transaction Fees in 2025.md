# Cryptocurrencies with the Lowest Transaction Fees in 2025  

In an era where blockchain transaction costs can fluctuate dramatically, identifying cryptocurrencies with the lowest fees is critical for maximizing value. This comprehensive guide explores the top 8 cryptocurrencies with negligible or zero transaction fees, explains how fees are calculated, and provides actionable strategies to minimize costs.  

## Understanding Crypto Transaction Fees  

Crypto transaction fees are charges incurred when transferring digital assets across blockchains. These fees compensate miners or validators for securing networks and prioritizing transactions during congestion. Fees vary based on network demand, blockchain architecture, and exchange policies.  

### Key Factors Influencing Transaction Fees  
- **Network Congestion**: High traffic increases fees.  
- **Blockchain Design**: Consensus mechanisms like Proof-of-Work (PoW) vs. Proof-of-Stake (PoS) affect costs.  
- **Transaction Size**: Larger data payloads (e.g., smart contracts) cost more.  

üîç **FAQ**: *Why do transaction fees fluctuate?*  
Fees spike during network congestion as users bid for faster confirmations. Conversely, off-peak hours reduce costs.

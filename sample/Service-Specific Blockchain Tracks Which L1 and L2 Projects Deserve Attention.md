### Historical Context of Blockchain Innovation

The 2020-2022 period saw foundational experiments in blockchain architecture:
- **Terra** pioneered algorithmic stablecoin mechanisms
- **FLOW** focused on NFT scalability
- **Cosmos** and **Polkadot** championed interoperability
- **Avalanche** introduced multi-chain architecture
- **NEAR** implemented sharding for enhanced throughput

These projects challenged the blockchain trilemma of balancing decentralization, security, and scalability. The emergence of ZK-Rollups, modular blockchain designs, and specialized programming languages like Move has now ushered in a new era of service-specific blockchain development.

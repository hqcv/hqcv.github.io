## Market Leadership Through Strategic Synergy

The acquisition positions Bitwise as a dominant force in digital asset management with total AUM exceeding $4.5 billion. This follows the successful launches of Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) and Bitwise Ethereum ETF (ETHW), which achieved $2 billion and $300 million AUM respectively within their first operating periods.

### ETC Group's Flagship Products

| Product | Symbol | Key Feature |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| BTCE | BTCE | Largest physical Bitcoin ETP in Europe |
| ET32 | ET32 | Ethereum ETP with staking rewards |
| ESOL | ESOL | Solana-focused ETP |
| GXRP | GXRP | XRP exposure vehicle |
| DA20 | DA20 | MSCI-indexed digital asset basket |

These products will gradually transition to the Bitwise brand while maintaining their existing investment strategies and physical backing structureâ€”a critical factor for institutional investors seeking stability in crypto markets.

## Expanding European Market Access

Hunter Horsley, Bitwise CEO, emphasized the strategic importance: "This acquisition enables us to serve European investors with localized expertise while maintaining our global innovation leadership. The combined entity offers clients comprehensive access to crypto markets through both traditional financial instruments and cutting-edge digital asset solutions."

The transaction addresses growing European demand for regulated crypto investment vehicles. ETC Group's established presence on major European exchanges (XETRA, Euronext, SIX, and Wiener BÃ¶rse) provides Bitwise with immediate infrastructure for cross-continental distribution.

## Product Innovation and Market Response

Bitwise's recent product launches demonstrate strong market acceptance:

- **BITB** achieved top-tier adoption, ranking among the 25 fastest-growing ETPs in history
- **ETHW** gathered significant assets within weeks of launch
- Combined crypto AUM growth: 120% year-over-year

Both ETFs operate under unique structures not registered under the 1940 Investment Company Act, offering investors alternative exposure mechanisms while maintaining regulatory compliance.

## Risk Management Framework

### Core Risk Categories

2. **Liquidity Exposure**: Developing markets may experience periodic illiquidity
3. **Regulatory Environment**: Evolving global crypto regulations impact operations
